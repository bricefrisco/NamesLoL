## Bugs and Feature Requests
All bugs and feature requests should be submitted by opening a Github [issue](https://github.com/bricefrisco/NamesLoL/issues).  
These can be opened to request a new feature, or to report a current feature that is unavailable.

## Installation
Create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/sign-up),   
Configure [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) by running `npm install -g serverless` and then running `serverless login`

To test locally, take a look at [Serverless Local Development](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-local-development).  
To deploy to test, run `serverless deploy`.   
To deploy to production, run `serverless deploy --stage prod`.   
That's it! Keep an eye out for output - you will receive links to your API in the console. You can also check AWS API Gateway to get the URLs for your API. You will need this when setting the `.env` in the front-end.

The first deployment may take a few minutes since AWS has to configure all the resources. Subsequent deployments will be much quicker.

Take a look at the [frontend](https://github.com/bricefrisco/NamesLoL-Frontend) for running and deploying the UI.
